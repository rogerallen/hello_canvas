# Hello Canvas

Just a toy to play with... A simple-minded ClojureScript animated
canvas drawing experiment based on David Nolen's mies leiningen
plugin.  See
http://swannodette.github.io/2013/10/27/the-essence-of-clojurescript/


Run this from a shell:
```shell
lein cljsbuild auto hello-canvas
```

Load index.html in your browser.

Edit `src/hello_canvas/core.cljs` to draw what you'd like.
